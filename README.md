# Leaflet-Part-1

Three files compose the structure of the map dashboard which displays earthquake data from the past week.
The HTML file provides the basic structure of the map and also relies on the other two files to provide more information about specific details.
The CSS file gives direction on where to place certain elements of the dashboard including the legend and the leaflet element.
The JavaScript (JS) file contains essential information about the earthquake data, the map used, and the legend. It also enhances visualization of specific earthquakes by color coding based on depth and introducing interactivity to individual instances of earthquakes via a popup triggered by clicking on an earthquake.
