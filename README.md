Special thanks to TA Drew for providing guidance through his speedruns. Special thanks as well to Kourt for advice to refine the legend.

# Leaflet-Part-1

Three files compose the structure of the map dashboard which displays earthquake data from the past week.
The HTML file provides the basic structure of the map and also relies on the other two files to provide more information about specific details.
The CSS file gives direction on where to place certain elements of the dashboard including the legend and the leaflet element.
The JavaScript (JS) file contains essential information about the earthquake data, the map used, and the legend. It also enhances visualization of specific earthquakes by color coding based on depth and introducing interactivity to individual instances of earthquakes via a popup triggered by clicking on an earthquake.

# Leaflet-Part-2

Three files compose the structure of the map dashboard which displays earthquake data from the past week. It also expands on the functionality provided by Leaflet Part 1
The HTML file provides the same functionality as the HTML file in Part 1 does.
The same can also be said about the CSS file.
On top of what is already provided by the JS file in part 1, the layers on the map have also been expanded upon. The addition of a street map can also visualize populated areas that are most affected by earthquakes and the Tectonic Plates which influence the location of earthquakes can be useful to detect patterns about the earthquakes' locations. These layers are also toggleable, meaning you can either obscure them from view or enable their visibility.
